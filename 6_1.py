Read up on one of the language technologies mentioned in this section, such as
word sense disambiguation, semantic role labeling, question answering, machine
translation, or named entity recognition. Find out what type and quantity of annotated
data is required for developing such systems. Why do you think a large
amount of data is required?

#Word sense disambiguation is a challenging field in natural language processing. 
#There are a number of different approaches to the problem, but currently the most 
#accurate involve supervised methods to train taggers using annotated corpora. 
#A large quantity of annotated data is needed to develop such software due to the 
#complexity of the problem and various contexts in which a given word can occur. 
#As with part of speach tagging, the more data a tagger sees in training, 
#the more accurate it will be when asked to process new data.
# Word sense disambiguation (WSD, or Word sense discrimination) needs such type of data as
# - annotated corpora
# - labeled training data sets
# - desicion rules
# - set of high-level classifiers with smart boundaries
# Most of WSD methods require large quantities of manually annotated training data in order to
#reach high accuracy of WSD.

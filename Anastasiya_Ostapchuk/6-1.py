print "What problems occur during the machine translation?"

print """Machine translation is difficult because a given word could have several possible translations (depending on its meaning), and because word order must be changed in keeping with the grammatical structure of the target language.
To overcome these difficulties, massive quantities of parallel texts are being collected from news and government websites that publish documents in two or more languages.
Using such documents or possibly a bilingual dictionary, we can automatically pair up the sentences (a process called text alignment).
Once we have a million or more sentence pairs, we can detect corresponding words and phrases, and build a model that can be used for translating new text.
The more data we collect, the more accurate machine translation will be."""
